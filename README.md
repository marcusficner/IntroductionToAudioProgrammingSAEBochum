# Introduction To Audio Programming, Meet the Masters at SAE Bochum

In honor of SAE Bochum's 10th birthday I visited the campus on December 8th 
to give a talk on audio programming.

There are four sample projects.

A simple gain plugin written in JUCE / C++ 
and three Max patches to show how audio plug-ins can be prototyped.

I've also used Desmos to talk about wave shaping:

A video of the talk might be available in the future.
